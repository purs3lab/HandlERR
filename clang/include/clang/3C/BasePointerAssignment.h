// For pointers using a range bound `bounds(__3c_tmp_p, __3c_tmp_p + n)`, an
// assignment `p = q` effectively changes the "base pointer" of the range
// bounds, so that the new bounds of `p` are `bounds(q, q + n)`
// (assuming `q` has the same size as `p`). For this to not invalidate the
// bound, `__3c_tmp_p` must also be updated to be equal to `q`.

# The Checked C clang repo

This repo contains a version of the LLVM/Clang toolchain that is being modified
to support Checked C. Checked C extends C with checking to detect or prevent
common programming errors such as out-of-bounds memory accesses. The Checked
C specification is available at the
[Checked C repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc).

## Announcements

### Source code update

On Feb 19, 2021 we updated the checkedc-clang sources to upstream release_110,
specifically [this](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/2e10b7a39b930ef8d9c4362509d8835b221fbc0a) commit.

On Feb 18, 2020 we updated the checkedc-clang sources to upstream release_90,
specifically [this](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/c89a3d78f43d81b9cff7b9248772ddf14d21b749) commit.

### Transition to monorepo

Early in 2019, the LLVM community
[transitioned](https://forums.swift.org/t/llvm-monorepo-transition/25689) to
"monorepo".

We moved Checked C to a monorepo on Oct 30, 2019. This has resulted in the following changes:

1. [checkedc-llvm](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-llvm) and
   [checkedc-clang](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang) (as well as other
   LLVM subprojects) are now tracked via a single git repo.

2. The [checkedc-llvm](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-llvm) repo will
   no longer be maintained. The
   [checkedc-clang](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang) repo will be the
   new monorepo.

3. There will be no changes to the
   [checkedc](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc) repo. It will continue to be
   a separate git repo.

4. All future patches should be based off this new monorepo.

5. You can use
   [this](https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc-clang/blob/master/clang/automation/UNIX/cherry-pick-to-monorepo.sh)
   script to cherry-pick your existing patches to the new monorepo.

6. Make sure to set the following CMake flag to enable clang in your builds:
   `-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang`

## Trying out Checked C

Programmers are welcome to use Checked C as it is being implemented. We have
pre-built compiler installers for Windows available for download on the
[release page](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/releases). For
other platforms, you will have to build your own copy of the compiler. For
directions on how to do this, see the [Checked C clang
wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki). The compiler user
manual is
[here](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc-clang/wiki/Checked-C-clang-user-manual).
For more information on Checked C and pointers to example code, see our
[Wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/checkedc/wiki).

## 3C: Semi-automated conversion of C code to Checked C

This repository includes a tool called 3C that partially automates the
conversion of C code to Checked C. Quick documentation links:

* [General information](clang/docs/checkedc/3C/README.md), including development
  status and how to contribute

* [Build instructions](clang/docs/checkedc/3C/INSTALL.md)

* [Usage instructions for the `3c` command-line tool](clang/tools/3c/README.md)
